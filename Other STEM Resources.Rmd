# Data Science

## Extraction of knowledge from large amounts of various forms of data. 

## Computer science + statistics + analytics + mathematics + **any field knowledge!**. 

## Demand for data scientists and data engineers has more than tripled over five years (+231%)`*`

# What are Python and R?

## Python is a more traditional programming language

## R was originally designed for statistics but has branched out into a more general-purpose language

# Python and R – the Similarities

## Both Python and R are used for:

## Loading data

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

## Geospatial Analysis
  
### This is my city!!

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-89.6169586, 20.9753704, zoom = 12)
```

## Doing (very cool) visualisations (with R)

The following map shows where surfers travel based on their twitter activity. Thousands of tweets containing #surf have been recovered and geocoded. Home and current locations are represented using great circles, using R

### More cool visualisations (with R)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size")
```

## Graphing (with Python)

Scatterplot on polar axis: Size increases radially in this example and color increases with angle (just to verify the symbols are being scattered correctly). `*`

```{python, echo=FALSE}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

# Compute areas and colors
N = 150
r = 2 * np.random.rand(N)
theta = 2 * np.pi * np.random.rand(N)
area = 200 * r**2
colors = theta

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='polar')

fig.set_size_inches(5, 5)
c = ax.scatter(theta, r, c=colors, s=area, cmap='hsv', alpha=0.75)
plt.show()
```

## Prediction

```{python, eval=FALSE}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

columns = ['carat', 'cut', 'price']

data = [[0.3, 'Ideal', 422],
        [0.31, 'Ideal', 489],
        [0.42, 'Premium', 737],
        [0.5, 'Ideal', 1415],
        [0.51, 'Premium', 1177],
        [0.7, 'Fair', 1865],
        [0.73, 'Fair', 2351],
        [1.01, 'Good', 3768],
        [1.18, 'Very Good', 3965],
        [1.18, 'Ideal', 4838]]

train = pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=columns)

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(train[features], train[target])
predictions = model.predict(carats)
```


$$ y = mx + b $$

$$ price = 4,627*carat - 1,062 $$

# The Case for Python

## Python is a general purpose programming language 

## It is used for software development as well as data science

## *MACHINE LEARNING!!*

# The Case for R

## R was developed in academia for use in STEM subjects

## It was originally used for building statistics packages and visualizations for researchers

## There are a huge number of statistical packages available in R (more than in Python, though Python is catching up)

# Python and R Developers in the Real World

## In the 1990s: Companies previously did not use R in production. Original R statistics packages were developed for individual researchers, not teams

## Today: Software and data science has progressed to be team based

## Data scientists share code on GitHub 

## Data scientists push insights into production

## Easier to collaborate in Python than in R, but lots of things are still being done in R by talented programmers.
